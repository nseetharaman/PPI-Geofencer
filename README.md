# PPI-Geofencer

This program geofences PPI-enabled PCAPs to a particular set of coordinates, extending out to either a small or large radius (small = 200m, large = 400m), then cross-correlates probe requests from a different geospatial reference point for commonalities.

(ELI5 Version: Sees if devices from one area have been in another.)
